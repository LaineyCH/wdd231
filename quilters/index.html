            <p>We are a culturally and geographically diverse group of woman with a common interest in sewing. We
                meet once a week for
                a coffee morning, where we socialise and work on hand sewing projects. We also set up regular
                workshops where we have the opportunity to teach each other new skills - sometimes they aren't even
                sewing! <br>
                <br>
                Most of us come from a quilting background, but amongst us there are very talented dress-makers, bag
                makers, cross stitchers, sashiko stitchers, etc. Some are very experienced, having sewn for 30+
                years, and others are complete beginners, only sewing their very first project after joining our
                group - with us you will find a warm welcome, no matter your skill or experience.
